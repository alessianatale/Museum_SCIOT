## Introduction
This is a project for the exam of Serverless Computing for IoT.

The idea is to **simulate an humidity sensor** placed in a museum to manage the humidity rate in order to **preserve the works of art**.  
The humidity rate should be **between 30% and 50%** so when it exceeds 50% a **dehumidifier is activated** and when it arrives at 30% the **dehumidifier is deactivated**.  

All the values are **simulated** because I am not in possession of any Iot devices.

## Architecture
To simulate the sending values of the humidity sensor
